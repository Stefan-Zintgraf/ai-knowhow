    "# Basic Prompt Structures Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on two fundamental types of prompt structures:\n",
    "1. Single-turn prompts\n",
    "2. Multi-turn prompts (conversations)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use OpenAI's GPT model and LangChain to demonstrate these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding different prompt structures is crucial for effective communication with AI models. Single-turn prompts are useful for quick, straightforward queries, while multi-turn prompts enable more complex, context-aware interactions. Mastering these structures allows for more versatile and effective use of AI in various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single-turn Prompts**: One-shot interactions with the language model.\n",
    "2. **Multi-turn Prompts**: Series of interactions that maintain context.\n",
    "3. **Prompt Templates**: Reusable structures for consistent prompting.\n",
    "4. **Conversation Chains**: Maintaining context across multiple interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a combination of OpenAI's API and LangChain library to demonstrate these prompt structures. The tutorial will include practical examples and comparisons of different prompt types."

    "This tutorial has introduced you to the basics of single-turn and multi-turn prompt structures. We've seen how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single-turn prompts are useful for quick, isolated queries.\n",
    "2. Multi-turn prompts maintain context across a conversation, allowing for more complex interactions.\n",
    "3. PromptTemplates can be used to create structured, reusable prompts.\n",
    "4. Conversation chains in LangChain help manage context in multi-turn interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these different prompt structures allows you to choose the most appropriate approach for various tasks and create more effective interactions with AI language models."
