        "# Prompt Templates and Variables Tutorial (Using Jinja2)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to creating and using prompt templates with variables in the context of AI language models. It focuses on leveraging Python and the Jinja2 templating engine to create flexible, reusable prompt structures that can incorporate dynamic content. The tutorial demonstrates how to interact with OpenAI's GPT models using these advanced prompting techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "As AI language models become increasingly sophisticated, the ability to craft effective prompts becomes crucial for obtaining desired outputs. Prompt templates and variables offer several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reusability**: Templates can be reused across different contexts, saving time and ensuring consistency.\n",
        "2. **Flexibility**: Variables allow for dynamic content insertion, making prompts adaptable to various scenarios.\n",
        "3. **Complexity Management**: Templates can handle complex structures, including conditional logic and loops, enabling more sophisticated interactions with AI models.\n",
        "4. **Scalability**: As applications grow, well-structured templates make it easier to manage and maintain large numbers of prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial aims to equip learners with the knowledge and skills to create powerful, flexible prompt templates, enhancing their ability to work effectively with AI language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "The tutorial covers several key components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **PromptTemplate Class**: A custom class that wraps Jinja2's Template class, providing a simple interface for creating and using templates.\n",
        "2. **Jinja2 Templating**: Utilization of Jinja2 for advanced templating features, including variable insertion, conditional statements, and loops.\n",
        "3. **OpenAI API Integration**: Direct use of the OpenAI API for sending prompts and receiving responses from GPT models.\n",
        "4. **Variable Handling**: Techniques for incorporating variables into templates and managing dynamic content.\n",
        "5. **Conditional Logic**: Implementation of if-else statements within templates to create context-aware prompts.\n",
        "6. **Advanced Formatting**: Methods for structuring complex prompts, including list formatting and multi-part instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method Details\n",
        "\n",
        "The tutorial employs a step-by-step approach to introduce and demonstrate prompt templating concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Setup and Environment**: The lesson begins by setting up the necessary libraries, including Jinja2 and the OpenAI API client.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Basic Template Creation**: Introduction to creating simple templates with single and multiple variables using the custom PromptTemplate class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Variable Insertion**: Demonstration of how to insert variables into templates using Jinja2's `{{ variable }}` syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Conditional Content**: Exploration of using if-else statements in templates to create prompts that adapt based on provided variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **List Processing**: Techniques for handling lists of items within templates, including iteration and formatting.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Advanced Templating**: Demonstration of more complex template structures, including nested conditions, loops, and multi-part prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Dynamic Instruction Generation**: Creation of templates that can generate structured instructions based on multiple input variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **API Integration**: Throughout the tutorial, examples show how to use the templates with the OpenAI API to generate responses from GPT models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The methods are presented with practical examples, progressing from simple to more complex use cases. Each concept is explained theoretically and then demonstrated with a practical application.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial provides a solid foundation in creating and using prompt templates with variables, leveraging the power of Jinja2 for advanced templating features. By the end of the lesson, learners will have gained:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Understanding of the importance and applications of prompt templates in AI interactions.\n",
        "2. Practical skills in creating reusable, flexible prompt templates.\n",
        "3. Knowledge of how to incorporate variables and conditional logic into prompts.\n",
        "4. Experience in structuring complex prompts for various use cases.\n",
        "5. Insight into integrating templated prompts with the OpenAI API.\n",
        "\n",
        "These skills enable more sophisticated and efficient interactions with AI language models, opening up possibilities for creating more advanced, context-aware AI applications. The techniques learned can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, from simple query systems to complex, multi-turn conversational agents."
