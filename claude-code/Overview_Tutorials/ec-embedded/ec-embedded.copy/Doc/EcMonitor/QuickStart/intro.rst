The |Product| Software Development Kit (SDK) offers the possibility for Data Tracing / Listening / Sniffing / Logging Diagnosis and Monitoring of |ECAT| Networks. It's suitable for new (Greenfield) and existing (Brownfield) installations. Also it's independent from |ECAT| MainDevice Controller Software and Hardware. A TAP device is required to observe the network traffic at a specific location in an |ECAT| network.

This Quick Start Guide briefly shows how to install and run the included example program. The |Product|'s User Manual contains information that is more detailed and is available at https://developer.acontis.com/ec-monitor.html\ .
