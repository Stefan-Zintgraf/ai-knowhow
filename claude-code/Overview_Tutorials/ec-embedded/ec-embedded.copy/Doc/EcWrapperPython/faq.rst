PyQt5 cannot be installed on Ubuntu 14.04 x64, because it requires Python 3.5. How can I install it?
    
    It can be installed by calling
    
    .. prompt:: bash
      
      sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5

I installed Python and the demo crashes with strange errors. What can I do?
    
    This might be a problem of mixing x86 with x64 binaries. Verify that if you have installed the Python runtime for x64 bit, please install also EC-Master for x64 bit.
